## AI-Powered Paraphrasing Tool

## Project Overview

This project is a paraphrasing system developed in Python using transformer models. The tool takes a block of input text and generates a paraphrased version while:

- Preserving the original meaning

- Improving clarity and fluency

- Ensuring originality

- Performing grammar and spelling correction

- Evaluating output quality using NLP metrics

**Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered paraphrasing tool using transformer-based models.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+

- Deep Learning & NLP Frameworks

- PyTorch

- Transformers library 

- Sentence Transformers

- T5 (for paraphrase generation)

- Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws

- language-tool-python

- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

- ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L

- Semantic Similarity

  ## Working

1. User inputs a sentence.

2. The T5 transformer model generates a paraphrased version.

3. The generated output is passed through a grammar correction module.

4. Evaluation metrics calculate:

5. The final paraphrased text and evaluation scores are displayed.
